First Slide
========================================================
# Introduction

->Our project is about the electricity output in Texas comparing wind power with windless power. 

->We will predict 24 hour loads of energy using past history of demands and identify how wind energy affects energy forecasting.

->We wanted to know how do electric companies know how much power they have to generate.

->We wanted to know why itâ€™s important to know how much electricity at least a day in advance.

Graphs
========================================================

```{r}
library(png)
library(grid)

```{r}
img1 <- readPNG('README_figs/README-electricity graph-1.png')
grid.raster(img1)

img2 <- readPNG('README_figs/README-wind output graph-1.png')
grid.raster(img2)

img3 <- readPNG('README_figs/README-January HeatMap-1.png')
grid.raster(img3)
