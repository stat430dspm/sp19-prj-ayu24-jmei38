->Our project is about the electricity output in Texas comparing wind power with windless power. 

->We will predict 24 hour loads of energy using past history of demands and identify how wind energy affects energy forecasting.

->We wanted to know how do electric companies know how much power they have to generate.

->We wanted to know why itâ€™s important to know how much electricity at least a day in advance.
