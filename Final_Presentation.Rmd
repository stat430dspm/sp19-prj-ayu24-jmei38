## Introduction/Background
- Data is from Electric Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT)
  - Manages the flow of electricity power and represents over 90% of the state's electric load
- Our focus is Predicting the next 24 hour load based on past historical data
```{r}
library(png)
library(grid)
img <- readPNG("ercotwebsite.png")
grid.raster(img)
```
- GOAL: Predict the next 24 hour load using past history of demands
