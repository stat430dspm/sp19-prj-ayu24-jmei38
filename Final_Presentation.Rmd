## Introduction/Background
- Data is from Electric Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT)
  - Manages the flow of electricity power and represents over 90% of the state's electric load
- Our focus is to predict the next 24 hour load based on past historical data
```{r}
library(png)
library(grid)
img <- readPNG("ercotwebsite.png")
grid.raster(img)
```
- GOAL: Predict the next 24 hour load using past history of demands


## Data Exploration I

```{r}
img <- readPNG("README-electricity graph-1.png")
grid.raster(img)
```
A peak around the summer time

## Winter vs Summer 

```{r cars, echo = TRUE}
img <- readPNG("README-July HeatMap-1.png")
grid.raster(img)
```

## Slide with Plot

```{r pressure}
plot(pressure)
```
